Tom Luque of [MastGates.com](http://www.mastgates.com/)  did this early work for a nice 3D-printed enclosure to use in conjunction with the Generation 3 regulator.

After it became apparent that 3D printing was not really a viable approach the regulator was resized to fit existing commercial cases.  Even so Tom kindly passed on his design files with the following note:


**"You are welcome to post the STL file, just give recognition to MastGates.com as the designer.  I'll share the rsdoc file if anyone is using "DesignSpark Mechnical" CAD. "**

Thank you Tom, sorry this did not work out to a more ongoing approach but do appreciate your guidance and coaching along the way.  Make sure to check out the other offerings Tom has at MastGates, where 3D printing is put to great use!
